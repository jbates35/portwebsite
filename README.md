## Portfolio Website

This should be filled more thoroughly later, but this is my portfolio website codebase.

This portfolio website is designed with Flask and deploys a backend user interface for myself (so I can motivate my lazy ass to keep updating my projects when I finish them), and a frontend which you would see when you go to https://jbateshobbies.ca/

Any important information should not be able to be accessed from this - this is actually a submodule of a different private repo which I have. That repo containers the docker compose script, all my juicy passwords, etc.
